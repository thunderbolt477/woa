                    <h2>MY STORY</h2>
                    <p>As I was standing up--surrounded by my group of friends, I noticed how disconnected I felt from my body. I started to hyperventilate (thinking that it was my asthma) and sat down on a chair realizing that I was gripping the edges firmly while pushing my body upwards. I had no idea what was happening. It was late by the time I left the house and on the way home, I noticed that I couldn't step on the gas anymore (I was going 25mph on a 45mph road), my eyes began to get hazy, and my hands gripped tightly on the steering wheel. When I got home, I went straight to my room and lay in my bed not knowing that the next few minutes were going to change my life forever.</p>
                    <p>   What I thought was a seizure was actually a panic attack. It was intense, to say the least, and my roommates at the time had to call 911 because all of us didn’t know what was going on with me. In a matter of minutes, my panic attack had stopped, I sat on the floor of my bedroom surrounded by firefighters. Turns out whatever just happened had everything to do with anxiety.</p>
                    <p>
                        After this experience, I knew the best thing to do for myself was to see a therapist--which is exactly what I did.
                        During that first therapy session, I found out that I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Explosive Temperament Disorder, and was told that my depression came back.
                    </p>
                    <p>It was not easy to hear any of it.</p>
                    <p>
                        ​Trying to navigate my anxiety was difficult. I struggled with insomnia, woke up every morning scared to leave my room or my house, and stopped going to my classes. I feared panic attacks striking and people judging me or not wanting me in their lives. I stopped taking care of myself physically (overeating or not eating at all, not showering for days, staying in bed, and substance abuse). I was treating my friends, my family, and even my partners at the time very poorly. I went from being a social butterfly to being cooped up in my cocoon. I overthought all my words, movements, actions, all of the above. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Altogether, I just lost control of everything and I started to lose myself in my anxiety.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        In the course of time, there was a lot of trial and error navigating the anxiety–but I found ways to live life with it. I first and foremost learned how to accept my diagnosis and eventually my anxiety, depression, and all things mental health became a passion of mine. And don’t get me wrong, there are still a lot of thing’s that I am learning about myself and my mental health struggles–but it’s all worthwile, because it has lead me here today.

            <h2>WHY COACHING?</h2>
            <p>During the first couple of years of navigating my anxiety, there were a lot of moments when I felt lost or alone--and despite having a great support system behind me, I still felt like no one understood what I was truly going through.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I have learned that I was never alone--I just needed someone who could relate to my struggles.</p>
            <p>This is why I wanted to become a life coach. I want to be that person in someone's life to help them feel less alone and guide them through their own journey with anxiety.</p>
